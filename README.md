# Custom shopify
I'm pretty sure there is a better way to write this code 
 shopify liquid code based on https://silver-sunflower-d9988a.netlify.app/test 
 
 #### The structure of the code for the Custom vertical scroller is as follows
 The text for image 2 or image 3 will only work if a image is selected that is per the design, If you want to make the text visiable feel free to add in your own code.

## This project is for shopify only with Gsap minimal animation and scroll triggers
- these components will only work in shopify
- you must know some shopify to make it work correctly
- **I don't have time to help you make it work correctly**
- This is for dawn 2.0 theme or any theme really
- You must enter your own presets in the schema.json
